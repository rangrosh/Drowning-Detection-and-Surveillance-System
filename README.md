# Drowning-Detection-and-Surveillance-System

A way to track a swimmer and establish communication between the swimmer and the shore in case of emergency.

This was a project done for the makeathon Imagineer conducted by ACM during March 2020. 

The buoyant device contains a pulse sensor, GPS module and NodeMcu for
communication on transmitter side. Whereas, an Arduino was used at the
receiver end.
